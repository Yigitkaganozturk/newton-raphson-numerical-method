# newton-raphson-numerical-method
this program finds an approximate value for the given polynomial function's one of the roots. It finds the value by using newton raphson method.
This program is designed for the plynomial functions. It finds one of the roots of the given function; to make it work it is necessary to give the terms of the function you want the program to work on. Started, the function asks the client 'to enter a function term, press e'. when e is pressed function asks for the coefficient and the power of the given term and then it asks again  'to enter a function term, press e'. when you compleatly define your function's all of the terms,it is adequate for you to enter a character tahat is differernt from e. So far the program has defined only the function. In the second stage program takes a random number from the client and then applies the newton rumphson method to find a approximate root of the given function. Untill the miscalculation limit is reached, program prints the tried x and y values so if it is wanted the approximation to be more valid it is enough to change the miscalculation value with a number that is smaller than authomatically given one that is 0.001.
